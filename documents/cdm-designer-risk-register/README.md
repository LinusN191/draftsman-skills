## Why this stub exists
Stubbed during Sprint D follow-up (2026-05-25) as part of the post-remediation scope-coverage audit. This domain was identified as **truly unscoped** (no folder anywhere in the repo) by Reviewer 1's coverage analysis, distinct from skills that are scoped-but-unbuilt elsewhere. Authoring blocked pending engineer brief or sprint resourcing.
