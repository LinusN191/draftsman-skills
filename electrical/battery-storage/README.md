## Reference implementation
See `electrical/lighting-layout/` (production) or `electrical/db-layout/` (beta) for the complete reference shape.

## Why this stub exists
Stubbed during Sprint D follow-up (2026-05-25) as part of the post-remediation scope-coverage audit. This domain was identified as **truly unscoped** (no folder anywhere in the repo) by Reviewer 1's coverage analysis, distinct from skills that are scoped-but-unbuilt elsewhere. Authoring blocked pending engineer brief or sprint resourcing.
